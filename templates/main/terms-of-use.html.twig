                                of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence),
                                arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.
                                You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any
                                other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release

                            <h5>17. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h5>
                            <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN
                                DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>

                            <h5>17.1. Binding Arbitration</h5>
                            <p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings
                                (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in
                                small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful
                                use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade
                                names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Company (a) waive your and Company’s respective
                                rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement or the Services
                                resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and Company’s respective rights to a jury trial.
                                Instead, you and Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the
                                referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making
                                a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a
                                judge or jury in court).</p>

                            <h5>17.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</h5>
                            <p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services is personal to you
                                and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be
                                brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
                                There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve
                                a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a
                                Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within
                                or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>

                            <h5>17.3. Federal Arbitration Act</h5>
                            <p>This Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17
                                will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in
                                accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the
                                maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

                            <h5>17.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</h5>
                            <p>Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute
                                within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith
                                to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Company will be sent by e-mail to Company at
                                <a href="/" >https://spacium.co</a>. Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in

                                Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Company cannot agree

                                the applicable party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance
                                with this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically
                                provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.</p>

                            <h5>17.5. Process</h5>

                                the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the
                                requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>

                            <p>As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will
                                have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive
                                decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable,
                                and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided,
                                however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a
                                representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an
                                individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over
                                any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more
                                than one individual.</p>

                                JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
